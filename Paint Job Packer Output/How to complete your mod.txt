Your mod has been generated and placed inside the "mi" folder.
There are a few steps left to finish it off. You'll need to replace the files listed in this document.



To test your mod as you make it, move the "mi" folder to your game's mod folder:
/home/(username)/.local/share/Euro Truck Simulator 2/mod



== Mod manager image ==
Mod_Manager_Image.jpg

A 276 x 162 JPEG image that represents your mod in the in-game mod manager.



== Mod manager description ==
Mod_Manager_Description.txt

Your mod's description in the mod manager.
It can be replaced, or you can modify the one that's already there.



== In-game paint job icon ==
material/ui/accessory/mi Icon.dds

A 256 x 64 DDS image that is shown in-game when you buy your paint job.
Stick to the shape in the placeholder for your icon to match the others in-game.



== Vehicle textures ==
All of the .dds files in:
vehicle/truck/upgrade/paintjob/mi/Iveco Stralis/

These are the main files of your mod, determining what your paint job will actually look like.
Replace or re-colour every DDS image in this folder.

Save each DDS in DXT5 format with mipmaps, if possible.
Ensure every file's height and width is a power of 2 (e.g. 16, 64, 2048, 4096 etc).
